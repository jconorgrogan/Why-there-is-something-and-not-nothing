# Why is there something rather than nothing?

## The Universe as Information
There are many competing theories about what the universe is made of, and why and how it exists. Quantum mechanics, general relativity, string theory—all these frameworks offer different perspectives. Yet, despite their differences, they share a fundamental agreement: information lies at the core of how we understand reality.

**Quantum Mechanics:** The universe is made up of particles whose properties (position, momentum, spin) are bits of information. Entanglement shows that information can be shared instantaneously across space, suggesting information is more fundamental than distance.

**General Relativity:** The universe is a fabric of spacetime, with mass and energy curving it. This curvature conveys information about the gravitational fields and matter distribution, making the geometry of spacetime a carrier of cosmic information.

**String Theory:** The universe consists of tiny vibrating strings, where each vibration pattern encodes information about particle properties. The fundamental elements of reality are informational, expressed through these string vibrations.

**Holographic Principle:** The universe's information is encoded on lower-dimensional boundaries, like a 3D image from a 2D surface. This theory suggests that the volume of space (and everything in it) can be described entirely by information stored on its boundary.

No matter how we attempt to frame the fundamental nature of the universe (whether through energy, consciousness, fields, or mathematics), each of these frameworks ultimately requires information to be processed, differentiated, and understood. 

## Reframing the Question: Why is there information?
We can thus rephrase the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?" into a more precise "How and why is there information rather than no information?" 

In order to attempt to formulate an answer to this question, we need to be precise on what information is and the conditions on which it may arise. 

## What is Information?

In a nutshell, information exists when one state can be identified as distinct from another. Without the ability to make such distinctions, no information can be conveyed. More specifically, the following criteria must be met:

### 1. Multiple Distinguishable States must be identified 
There must be more than one possible state that can be differentiated. Information arises when these states are distinguishable in some observable or meaningful way. For example, a light switch has two possible states: "on" and "off." These states are distinct because they produce different effects—light or darkness. If only one state existed, no information could be conveyed because there would be nothing to compare. 

### 2. There must be a common basis to make any distinction 
For the distinction between states to be meaningful, the states must share a common basis within the same system. This commonality provides the framework that allows the states to be compared and understood in relation to each other. For example, in the light switch system, both "on" and "off" pertain to the function of controlling light. They are distinguishable within this shared framework of light control, and it is this commonality that enables the comparison between these states. States outside this framework (e.g., the color of the switch) do not contribute to the informational content in this context.

###  3.The system must have boundaries, which define what is possible; As such there must be some set of non-disguishable and non-Possible States 
The system must differentiate between states (that are distinguishable) that "can occur", and those that are non distinguishable, or outside of the realm of possibilities. In the light switch example, the states "on" and "off" are possible, whereas a state like "half-on" or "floating" is non-possible. Non-possible states are irrelevant to the system and fall outside its scope; furthermore they can be considered indistinguishable from the perspective of the system alone. 

## Information requires multiple states of comparison: Enter the Role of the Observer

Information is viewed and interpreted via an observer who has the:

**Ability to Differentiate**
The observer must have the inherent ability to make distinctions—whether through sensory perception, measurement, or conceptual analysis. This capability to differentiate between various states is what gives rise to information. Think of the observer as a function capable of outputting distinct values.

**Comparison Across Multiple States**
Information only becomes meaningful if the observer can compare multiple states. It’s not enough to observe a single state; the value of information emerges from the relationship between distinguishable states. Without multiple states to compare, the observer cannot produce any informational content.

**Unique Perspective on Indistinguishability**
What differentiates observers is their individual perspective on what is indistinguishable or "not possible" within a system. Each observer has their own set of differentiable constraints that defines what distinctions they can make and what is beyond their capacity to perceive or differentiate.

To be clear: The observer’s constraints and imperfections are what shape and limit the ability to distinguish between states.  For example, a person with limited color vision may be unable to distinguish between certain shades of color that others can easily differentiate. This constraint directly limits their ability to perceive the full range of possible states within the system of color perception. The more limited or constrained the observer is, the fewer distinctions they can make. In this way, their ability to differentiate is dependent directly on the information itself

Notably, _Observers_ have Distinguishable States themselves; they are informational.

With these definitions in mind, then the challenge is understanding how information might "emerge" in the first place 

## Thought Experiment: Let's assume that there is _no_ information in a universe 

Consider a world with no information. In such a universe, there is no space or time, no matter or energy, no forces or interactions. Everything is homogenous; every point is identical to every other point. Going back to our original definitions, this universe is non-distinguishable, does not have multiple possible states, and has no common basis for distinction.

In mathematics, a singularity is a point at which a mathematical object is not well-behaved in some particular way. At the singular singularity point, there is no direct information that can be extracted. This is because we cannot compute or define anything at that point using the usual methods. It's as if the singularity represents an "informational void" within the structure. Notably, all of our critera for information that we previously established are not met:

1. Distinguishability Breaks Down: We cannot easily identify multiple distinct states within the singularity.
2. Common Basis Is Lacking: Standard frameworks for comparison fail.
3. Boundaries Are Exceeded and break down: Quantities go beyond the defined limits of the system.

As such, a candidate for a universe with no information is one that holds are all possible singularities across all possible reference frames.

## Information must emerge from all possible singularities 

**ADE Classifacations**
Here, Math seems to provide an interesting description/candidate for this notion of all singularities across all reference points: ADE classification.  The simply laced Dynkin diagrams of ADE represent all possible ways that singularities can appear and be viewed from any perspective, in any system. If we consider each ADE diagram as mapping out the potential structures of breakdowns in differentiation of all possible singularities. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADE_classification 

In the context of singularities, even though each singularity represents a point of breakdown, their classification (like in the ADE scheme) enables us to differentiate between them. This differentiation is the foundation of informational content.

By conceptualizing the universe as a collection of all possible singularities, we are  effectively saying that information arises from the distinctions and relationships between these singularities. This turns the "void" into a relational system, where the information content is encoded in how these points of collapse (singularities) relate to one another. This relational structure is what gives rise to information, even in what might initially seem like an informational void...  In a broader sense, singularities can be seen as reference points that allow us to define distinguishable states in the first place. Without some set of singularities (or boundaries), there would be no framework within which to define different states—and thus, no information. By classifying singularities and establishing relationships between them (as in ADE classification or moduli spaces), you are essentially creating a system of distinguishable states from which information emerges.

# All Singularities → ADE Classification
Mathematics can arise from connection points between the ADE like so:

The **ADE classification** organizes simple singularities using Dynkin diagrams of types $A_n$, $D_n$, and $E_6$, $E_7$, $E_8$. These singularities correspond to specific Lie algebras and symmetry groups, capturing all possible simple symmetries in these contexts.

# ADE Classification → Symmetries and Lie Algebras

The Dynkin diagrams represent the root systems of simple Lie algebras.

- **Type $A_n$** corresponds to $\mathfrak{sl}(n+1)$, associated with the special unitary group $SU(n+1)$.
  
These Lie algebras describe the symmetries of various mathematical and physical systems, including rotational symmetries.

# Symmetries → Random Matrix Theory (GUE)

The **Gaussian Unitary Ensemble (GUE)** consists of random Hermitian matrices invariant under unitary transformations. These matrices embody the unitary symmetries described by the type $A_n$ Lie algebras. The eigenvalues of GUE matrices exhibit statistical properties that model complex quantum systems.

# Random Matrices (GUE) → Riemann Zeros

The statistical distribution of the eigenvalues of GUE matrices matches the distribution of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line. This connection was suggested by **Montgomery's pair correlation conjecture** and supported by **Odlyzko's numerical evidence**. It reveals a profound link between quantum mechanics (through random matrix theory) and number theory.

# Riemann Zeros → Prime Numbers

The non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function encode information about the distribution of prime numbers via the explicit formulas in analytic number theory. The **Riemann Hypothesis**, asserting that all non-trivial zeros lie on the critical line $\Re(s) = \frac{1}{2}$, has deep implications for the accuracy of the Prime Number Theorem and the error term in the distribution of primes.

As such, the encoded positions of the prime numbers are descendent from this universe of no information. 

**Measurement as an Interaction Between Distinct Frames of Indistinguishability**

When we think about observation or measurement, traditionally, we might think of a passive process where an observer simply detects or records the state of a system. However, if we reframe observers as entities with unique "frames of indistinguishability," eg points of comparison between singularity frames,  then measurement becomes an active interaction between these frames.

### Appendix: Mathematical Examples on How Differences Can Emerge:

- **Legendre's Three Squares Theorem**: Legendre's Three Squares Theorem states that a natural number n can be expressed as the sum of three integer squares if and only if n is not of the form n=4^a(8b+7), where a and b are non-negative integers. This theorem highlights that in three-dimensional space, certain numbers cannot be represented as the sum of three squares due to inherent mathematical constraints.
  
  **Example**: The number 7 cannot be expressed as the sum of three squares because it fits the form n=4^0(8 × 0 + 7) = 7. However, the number 6 can be expressed as 6=1^2 + 1^2 + 2^2.

- **Lagrange's Four Squares Theorem**: In contrast, Lagrange's Four Squares Theorem asserts that every natural number can be expressed as the sum of four integer squares. This difference between three-dimensional and four-dimensional representations introduces a natural distinction based solely on dimensionality.
  
  **Implication**: The inability to represent certain numbers as the sum of three squares in 3D, but the ability to do so in 4D, creates a differentiation. This difference is information that arises naturally from the properties of numbers and dimensions.
